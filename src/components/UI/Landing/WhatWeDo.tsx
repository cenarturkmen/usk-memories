            Our community is made up of people from all walks of life who come
            together to document the world around us through art. We believe
            that urban sketching is a powerful tool for storytelling and that it
            can help people connect with their surroundings in a more meaningful
            way. As part of the global Urban Sketchers community, we are
            committed to promoting the practice of urban sketching and sharing
            our work with others. We are a non-profit organization and we donâ€™t
            have any political or religious affiliations.
